## You can survive any failure

"The main thing people are controlled by is their thoughts and perceptions of themselves. If you're taught you can't do anything, you won't do anything."\[1] - Kanye West. Kanye West recently went on a lot of crazy rants (like he always does), and while I condemn his actions, he still had a number one album, and is one of the most successful artists of all time. I believe a lot people in this world are held back due to fear of failure. If there is one thing that hip hop can teach you is that one can survive even the worsts of failures, so there should not be any fear. There are many rappers, like Fivio Foreign, who have gone to jail and they simply kept writing and rhyming.\[2] Nothing can stop you from honing your craft. It is not the case of those people "grinding" in jail where they are somehow unhappy. Your brain can adjust to any circumstance so while the initial blow of the possibility of going to jail might be difficult to handle, eventually it will pass over and your brain will adopt to its environment and be just as happy as it was before.
## Hurt people hurt more people

The reason why a lot of rappers act the way they do and do the things they do even if they might seem awful actions by "society"'s standard, is because they are hurt themselves. This is called trauma and it is especially bad when it is done at a young age. You are severely shaped by your environment and the environment these rappers grew up in was very adversarial, leading to them developing defence mechanisms and thinking certain things are normal as they were normal in their environment. This does not justify their actions, as this cycle trauma should be broken so the communities can heal. One must deal with their issues not hurt those who are seen as "lesser" or anything. Kendrick Lamar deeply analyzes this issue in his album "Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers". He talks about the trauma leading to Kodak Black acting the way he has and how he relates to it even though he hasn't done actions as bad.\[5] I personally can not do this issue justice as it is quite complicated but I wanted to put it here anyways.
## Creation is therapeutic

A lot of rappers retire after making millions of dollars and then they suddenly come back. They usually cite as their reasons that they could simply not survive without rapping. Eminem said he doesn't like holding thoughts in his head. He will always write it down. They find the act of rapping therapeutic. As Rick Rubin states in his book "The Creative Act: A Way of Being", most artists start creating art because they are saying something that they can not tell anyone else. (p. 75) For the purposes of letting the thought out, they start writing it down or rapping it. This is partly why rap might seem very vulgar and "unsafe", even from artists who talk normally in interviews like Drake. They rap what they can't tell anyone else. Creation of art in general can be a very therapeutic act.
## Life is a balance

One must take care of their emotional and physical needs as needed. One simply can not try to work all the time to make it ahead of others or some combination of that. One must do what is in their heart to a balance so one can sustain their effort. Trying to make it by working all the time is both unrealistic and unsustainable. "At times you gotta step away, do some livin'  
Let time provide a new prescription, givin' truer vision"\[4] - J. Cole. Simply stepping away from your work and doing another activity can be productive.
## False Prophets

Do not idolize people, even those who are deemed as highly successful by "society", no matter the metric (money, grades, iq, looks, etc...). We're all humans at the end of the day, we all make mistakes and have our limits. Those are deemed as super successful, like the Zuckerbergs, Thiels, and Musks of the world, had to get very lucky to make it in addition to their hard work. Simply being born in North America was a massive privilege, so was having access to computers. This means they are not "all-knowing" or "gods" in every single subject or even their own subject. No matter how successful someone is or how big someone's ego might get or how powerful they have become, it does not make them better than anyone else. They also have insecurities and bad thoughts (aka demons). They also might become completely out of touch as they become rich with the struggles of every day folks, leading to decisions that barely make sense to the common man. Their advice might also simply not apply to those at completely different circumstances than them. They might even have really bad vices (alcohol, drugs, porn, sex, etc...) and be functional addicts. Talent also does not choose morality. Someone can be very good at what they do and still be immoral.
## These rappers insecure

Bragging, insulting and bullying can be just as insecure as someone who is constantly telling you they feel inferior. The rappers who constantly flex or talk about how rich they are or how many girls they're having sex with, are insecure in those areas. They are simply showing their insecurities. The term for this is "projection" where they put others down based on their own insecurities. They might look very confident on the outside, but that is just compensation for their deep insecurities. This is especially evident in the current culture of "red-pillers" and Tates of the world being popular, who are people who act very confident while being insecure on the inside. Everyone has demons
## We are all on our own journeys in life

Complexes are bad. There are many rappers with superiority, god or saviour complexes. These are all bad as one can go on their own journey in life without thinking they are better than anyone or above anyone or that they are some divine being. Inferiority complex is also bad in addition since there is no reason to believe you are worst than anyone else as we are all on our own journeys. "There is no such a thing as a life that's better than yours"\[6] J. Cole says as he reflects that his happiness was not strictly increasing as he got more rich or famous or anything. Lots of people also say a certain song saved their lives or certain people saved them, but in reality, they saved themselves after getting a bit of a boost. "...the real God is in you, not the music you coppin"\[7] - J. Cole
## You gotta take the highs with the lows

One can not simply be happy all the time. That's part of the reason why rappers can become addicted to drugs and other substances (RIP Mac Miller). They want to stay in a state of constant happiness, especially at their peak of when they were famous. One simply has to feel pain sometimes, and get through it to get back to their state of happiness. Being happy all the time is unachievable naturally and that's ok.
