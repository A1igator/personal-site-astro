## Introduction

In an era where technology dominates our lives, it often feels like we are losing touch with our true selves. With the rise of short-form content, Gen Z generation seems to be perpetually glued to their screens. As a software engineer, my job relies heavily on technology, making me especially vulnerable to its pervasive influence. There's a quote by Tony Stark in Spiderman Homecoming which resonated with me. He says: "If you're nothing without the suit, you shouldn't have it"[^1]. It gives the lesson, to especially those in tech, that if you can not survive without technology, you should re-evaluate your relationship with it. In my journey in the last few years to gain independence from modern tech, I came across a few important lessons that have been helpful, and I wanted to share those with the world. Some of this might seem like common sense, but to ensure this piece is comprehensive, I have included everything.

## Technosolutionism

The solution to every problem is not always more technology. As Software Engineers, we tend to have a tendency to want to add more and more technology to our lives since our brains have adapted that way. This is not always a good strategy. For instance, the solution to loneliness isn't found in dating apps; I've found more meaningful connections through hobby groups. Similarly, my fitness journey became more effective when I joined a dragon-boat team, which kept me accountable and motivated. The solution to stopping bad habits is not as simple as an extension to block certain sites, it also requires mindfulness and understanding of internal states. There are many more examples. I'm sure other industries have something similar (i.e. a politician assumes policy solves every problem), but it is good to be mindful of this habit.

## Importance of social life, friends and family

Being surrounded by people is both good for mental health and to ensure you're not going insane. People can ensure your ideas are not too crazy so you do not fall off a cliff. Going against the grain can have some benefits, but is important to have balance and not try to take on the world by yourself. Being around people with different perspectives (i.e. making friends outside tech), can ensure one keeps themselves grounded and does not burn out. No matter how good zoom calls or even the metaverse gets, nothing can replace the in person interaction of being around those you love. A hug by itself can feel great which is impossible to get through a computer screen.

## Importance of hobbies

It is simply important to allocate some time to take your mind off of your job. It is important to ensure you can have a break and have rest. Your brain is not built to do one activity at a time and it needs breaks. You need to pick activities it can do during said breaks, like exercise,  reading, playing music, playing video games, etc... The activity does not necessarily have to be productive, but the goal of it should be to refresh afterwards, not to feel worse. It is important to be mindful of how you feel during and after the activity. If you find an activity is making you feel worse after or during it, then it's best to stop said activity.

## Regulate social media usage and content consumption

I'm not gonna sit here and pretend one can completely cut themselves off from the world and family and friends. I'm also not going to pretend that it is good for us to be online all the time. There is a balance to be had here, and for me that balance is achieved by a) remove all forms of short form content, as I don't find it helps me in any shape or form since it is highly addictive and I don't personally retain much information from it. b) Only use text based social media on the computer and don't keep apps like Reddit or Twitter(X) on my phone, as I personally struggle with not reading them if they are on the phone. c) Delete Spotify off my phone as well as I struggle with not listening to music compulsively (the main issue is music with lyrics that matches thoughts I have). I'm sure different people have different relationships with what they find addicting but that's what works for me.

## Health and Well-being

I'm not a psychologist and far from it, but I personally found my brain to be much happier as I ate healthier, exercised regularly, went out in nature and sunlight, slept well, and got sick less. Both water and grass increase my happiness. The term "touch grass" is a meme in our generation, but it is very much good advice and applies. I also have recently picked up cooking more from services like "hello fresh", and I find it both more therapeutic and I find it easier to eat healthy to feel better mentally and physically. Getting enough sleep and having a consistent sleep schedule ensures you always feel good and well rested. One also has to keep both themselves and the area they live in clean, as that by itself can provide psychological and health boost. Getting sick is also obviously bad for health. Need to ensure that one has a plan for sickness (ie calling a doctor), and take the needed precautions to ensure one does not get sick often (ie don't be around too many sick people etc...). Just hoping your sickness goes away by distracting yourself with things is a bad idea.

## My Journey to tame my ticks

I have struggled with being able to maintain focus (ie not think all the time), since I was a kid. I used to first bite my nails, but that is obviously bad for my nails and blocks my face if I want to talk. I then cracked my knuckles but that is really bad for my joints. I used to basically make origami from the side of my papers as well, but I stopped doing that more and more I used technology. I then twirled my hair and beard for a while but that is also bad for socializing as it blocks my face. Eventually, at the age of 22, I think I have finally found a solution. When I am alone and I really need to focus (ie while coding or writing), I still twirl my hair, but when I'm socializing, I've opted to playing with a ring. The ring helps me fill the little bit of distance between my thoughts so I do not think too much. I can now listen while talking to people outside a school environment! I've also been experimenting with fidget toys and those with sliding mechanics seem to work best for me.

## Importance of religious teachings

While I would still consider myself agnostic (philosophically the arguments for and against god or a higher being seem very inconclusive to me, and I still have a chip of my shoulder from living in the middle east and seeing what religious extremism going too far), I still use a lot of the religious teachings that I was brought up with as life frameworks. There are a lot of clear wisdoms in those teachings, in terms of activities to not overindulge in, rituals and communities that bring people together, being good to others, and psychological benefits of things like prayer, affirmations, gratefulness. Not everything in those texts should be taken as gospel (for example, I am against all the calls to hate the non-believers), but it is important to see why this way of life had worked for so long and was so popular. For me personally, it has been helpful to consider "what would a religious person do", in many situations.

## Conclusion

I find in the modern day, many people mindlessly use technology without knowing why they do. While technology can be an incredibly powerful tool, it is important to recognize that is still a tool that needs to be in service of the human not the other way around. While that sounds simple, it is difficult to do in practice due to the addictive nature of the devices. As our generation was raised on technology, I believe it is extra hard for us to have a healthy relationship with it, and outside of it. I hope my learnings above can help others on this journey to be more mindful of the tools they are using. Ultimately, the goal of technology use should be to help us, not to enslave us.
