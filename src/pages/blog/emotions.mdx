## Introduction

The term emotional maturity refers to someone being able to gauge their own emotions and other people's. It simply stems from being mindful of when you're feeling something and why you're feeling it, rather than giving into all your emotional instincts. It is also a function of empathy as it can help you understand why others might act the way they do after understanding yourself. Emotional Maturity has helped me the most out of everything I have ever learned and wanted to provide this article so others can learn too. 

## We're all on our own journeys in life

In a world where the biggest figures keep telling us how important self improvement is and how success is deemed more important than everything else, it is important to realize that the emotions of success look the same to everyone. A billionaire can only be as happy as an average person. This is important to realize so one can focus on their internal happiness as opposed to trying to hit some external goal that they think will bring them happiness. A lot of times internal and external goals can line up though so I believe it is a mistake to simply avoid all external things. Buying things can feel good. Making money can feel good. Getting fit can feel good. There is no need to hyper-focus on trying to feel good without any external stimuli.

## There are many paths to "success"

Even taking the most shallow definition of success of becoming rich, I'd argue the simplest path is to create products people like. How does that usually happen? One finds a pain point in their own life, and creates something (product, service, etc...) to address said pain point and offers it to others for money. This means both Android and iOS can have a market, without one massively overtaking the other, even if they have vastly different product philosophies. They both solve pain points for different type of creator and consumer. When you take into account other definition of "success", like emotional well being, interpersonal relationships, etc... it becomes more clear that there is no one size fit all approach.

## Figuring out what activities are good for you is much easier 

A lot of people nowadays seem to be stuck in this arbitrary routine of habits and trying to have perfect work life balance. There's also a lot of people who seem to be stuck in the other arbitrary acquiring of external goals like money, status or fitness. There are even philosophers, influencers and other "thinkers" who spend decades trying to explain and create "meaning of life" books, which are usually simply what worked for them and really does not apply generally. You will simply feel better after some activities and worse after others, and that is a very simple and effective way of living. Some things are obviously unavoidable (ie death in a family). But simply doing your best to do things that make you feel good or even return you to baseline (ie crying after death in a family) is very important as opposed to doing things that are a wash and mostly a waste of time (ie scrolling TikTok). This is a much more robust method of ensuring you don't overdo things and finding happiness than more arbitrary things (ie religion or legislation banning all video games and social media etc...).

## Rigid habits are not sustainable

This idea that the way you live life is to build it in a way to be productive and really fit via structuring your day perfectly is unhealthy. This hustle is especially prevalent in America. It's very American Psycho like and that movie was a critique of it not a glorification like many have taken it. If life was as simple as habits then there would be no alcoholics and we would all be happy all the time. Humans are simply not machines meant to repeat the same tasks over and over. Pay attention to your emotions. Sometimes you need vacations. Sometimes you need to watch a movie. Some days you don't need to work out simply because you're not feeling it. Your body knows you much better than any productivity or fitness guru would.

## Vices generally mask uncomfortable emotions

I'm defining vices and addiction as things you want to stop doing but can't. This is partly why you can be addicted to anything. Most people with addictions do those things like drugs and alcohol and even video games and social media because they'd want to stop feeling something. It's not because they "lack" self control or are lazy or love drugs. It is always better to simply let those thoughts come and out of you (via whatever coping mechanisms you have like writing), than trying to hide them away or bottling them up. The drugs will simply waste your time and make things worse for you over time even if they temporarily mask the emotions. This is what makes vices so dangerous too. They are inertially worse when someone is struggling with difficult emotions. So while one might think to themselves "I'm already dealing with \[insert struggle\], which means I can't be productive anyways, so why not do \[insert vice\]". While it might be tempting to fall into this way of thinking, it is very dangerous as it is making your recovery from said struggle worse.

## Humans simply have limits

I wish I could do things like read a book with sheer willpower but that's just not possible. You're going to feel tired, anxious, depressed, heartbroken etc... sometimes and it will impact your productivity and that's ok. You need to allow yourself rest and time. You will have better reaction time and think faster when you're not in a bad state of mind than when you are, and being in said state of mind is inevitable. This is important to keep in mind, especially for making important decisions. Only make such decisions when you feel well rested and mentally well (and sober obviously :)).

## Just because you feel something it doesn't make said thing true

You're allowed to feel anxious while giving a presentation and it won't change the quality of it. We all feel anxious. You're allowed to feel angry if someone cuts you off while driving. You're allowed to feel emotions. It is better to deal with these emotions healthily though, but there is no need to assume you need to be a robot that only feels certain emotions at selective times. Bottling up emotions and trying to act a certain way is a bad thing, and healthy coping mechanisms are good (Cry if you're sad, punch a punching bad if you're angry, etc...). 

## Empathy towards yourself and others

You're allowed to feel like shit and tired and do nothing productive for a day. It happens to everyone. This also means you have to be mindful that your colleagues isn't necessarily "lazy" but they might be going through something. You're allowed to cry due to someone passing. You're allowed to be angry if someone steals your things. You're allowed to have emotions because they are out of your control. How you control said emotions are in your control though and as a mature person you should be able to control them better and better. You can have slip ups some days. We all have them. Sometimes the situation is also just not black and white. Some people deserve to get yelled at no matter how much you'd like to not show any anger, sometimes you will need to cry to someone no matter how good your coping mechanisms are, etc...

## Sometimes rest is the solution no matter what your logical brain tells you

Sometimes you're just tired. A lot of people seem to think that being alert and awake and sleeping as late as possible is best for productivity but that's just not true. You're a human being and you need to give your body rest when it demands it, not distracting it with dumb video games or scrolling instagram. Trying to squeeze every last bit of awake time from yourself is a losing battle and sometimes resting earlier is the more productive task. In our world of overstimulation with social media, we can trick ourselves into thinking we're being productive even when we are really tired easily (ie scrolling tiktok). This is a bad habit and should be avoided. Rest when you need rest.

## The science

This part for those who are more scientifically minded like me. I'm going to butcher this as I am not a neurologist, but your brain is divided into multiple parts. It is important to note the limbic system is the emotional part and the frontal lobe is the logical thinking part. I think it is important to be aware of this and not try to do things like logic your way out of depression. You need to provide things for the limbic system directly to make it happy, and frontal lobe can not control your happiness much. Just being mindful of their separation can help with understanding emotional maturity deeper.

## Conclusion

I think gaining emotional maturity has helped with many aspects of my life, such as creating art, understanding AI, and being happier in general. It helps with art to understand what emotions are going into your pieces and understand what emotions you are conveying. It helps with understanding AI, as it can show you the difference between emotionless pieces an LLM can create vs a human. Finally, it can bring you more happiness as you start optimizing for internal happiness as opposed to external. This is just the tip of the iceberg on its uses, and I hope my findings in this piece can help others too!
